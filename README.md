# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this project, I used JQuery, CSS, and HTML to create a simple work scheduler with local data storage. The scheduler also includes moment.js for time manipulation. The scheduler only shows 9-5 (business hours), and the current hour (depends on the real local time) is marked as red in the calendar. The past hours are marked in gray, and the future ones are marked in green. Users can easily add their daily items in the calendar, and through local storage, user input will be saved. 

## Getting Started

The users will see the scheduler when they land on the page and depending on their local time, they will see the color-codes. 

The screenshot below shows how the users will see it (in this example, the current time is 9 AM and the future time is marked in green)

The time that has already passed will be marked in gray (the screenshot below).
